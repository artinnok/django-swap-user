# Django-Swap-User (Beta)

## About
If you are tired from copying one custom user model from one project to another ones - use this package.
This will do all for you. 


## Installation
```
pip install django-swap-user
```

## Basic usage
1. Choose one of models that suits for you and copy related settings from the table:

| Application name      | Username field | Description                                                           | `INSTALLED_APPS`                          | `AUTH_USER_MODEL`                      |
|-----------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `swap_to_email`       | `email`        | User with `email` username                                            | ```"swap_user", "swap_to_email",```       | `"to_email.swap_to_email"`             |
| `swap_to_named_email` | `email`        | User with `email` username, `first_name` and `last_name` extra fields | ```"swap_user", "swap_to_named_email",``` | `"swap_to_named_email.NamedEmailUser"` |
| `swap_to_phone`       | `phone`        | User with `phone` username                                            | ```"swap_user", "swap_to_phone",```       | `"swap_to_phone.PhoneUser"`            |
| `swap_to_phone_otp`   | `phone`        | User with `phone` username  and OTP authentication                    | ```"swap_user", "swap_to_phone_otp",```   | `"swap_to_phone_otp.PhoneOTPUser"`     |

2. Add corresponding app to `INSTALLED_APPS`:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    "swap_user",
    "swap_to_named_email",
    ...
]
```
3. Change `AUTH_USER_MODEL` to corresponding:
```python
AUTH_USER_MODEL = "swap_to_named_email.NamedEmailUser"
```

4. Apply migrations:
```bash
python manage.py migrate swap_to_named_email
```


## Architecture
Application `swap_user` split into 3 apps:
  - `to_email` - provides user with `email` username field
  - `to_named_email` - provides user with `email` username field and with `first_name`, `last_name` extra fields
  - `to_phone` - provides user with `phone` username field
  - `to_phone_otp` - provides user with `phone` username field and with OTP authentication
  
  
## Why so unusual architecture?
Because if we leave them in one app, they all will create migrations and tables - such approach leads us to redundant tables.
They will be treated as 3 custom models within the same app, which causes perplexing and cognitive burden.

With such approach (when there is a common app which contains internal apps) - the user 
choose and connect only the specific user model which suits best for concrete business-logic. 

I have found such approach at Django REST Framework `authtoken` application and decide to use it - reference is [here](https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework/tree/master/rest_framework/authtoken).


## Providing User model at start of project
When you are starting a project from zero or scratch - this is a best moment to provide custom User model.
Because you have't a lot of migrations or you can easily regenerate them. Moreover, Django's [official docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/customizing/#using-a-custom-user-model-when-starting-a-project)
recommend to provide custom User model even if you are fully satisfied with default one - in future it will be easier to extend custom model that fits into your business cases.


## Providing User model at mid of project
This is a harder way of doing things, but it is still possible to do:
- Do all the steps at testing database and ONLY IF all of them was successful - try to apply at production environment
- Please note that these steps are **common** - they fit in most cases, but in some circumstances you need act on situation.
- Create a backup of your database
- Add stable tag into your repository or save a commit hash reference
- Pray to the heavens
- Remove all of yours migrations in every app of Django's project
- Remove all records from `django_migrations` table, for example with SQL `TRUNCATE django_migrations`
- Now we have a "clean" state, so we can change default model
- Generate new migrations for all of your applications - `python manage.py makemigrations` 
- Install this library and follow all instructions
- Now we need to [fake migrate](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/django-admin/#cmdoption-migrate-fake) because we already have all the tables with data - `python manage.py migrate --fake`
